#  Introduction to the algorithm 

   PCL :: registration :: CorrespondenceEstimation, is to find the correspondence between the base class, when the input is < pcl :: Point XYZ > data type, is based on the correspondence between the point search, when the input is a feature descriptor, is based on the feature descriptor correspondence lookup. 

##  1. How to use 

 Taking the correspondence search based on the FPFH feature descriptor as an example, the code is written as follows: 

  ```python

  ```  
>  Simply change the default data type pcl :: Point XYZ to pcl :: FP FH Signature 33. The same applies to other types of feature descriptors.
