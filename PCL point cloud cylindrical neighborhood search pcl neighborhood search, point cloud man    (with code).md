#  Introduction to the principle 

   The cylindrical neighborhood search is an extended application of the KD-tree algorithm in point cloud data processing, and has unparalleled advantages in some specific scene applications. Its main principle is to project the point cloud onto a specified plane, then perform a circular neighborhood search based on the plane, and then backproject the search results back to get the point cloud in the cylindrical neighborhood. The following example code, knowing the coordinates of a point on the trunk, performs a cylindrical neighborhood search on the point, and can roughly extract the trunk.
