##  1. Fitting overview 

 â€ƒâ€ƒB-spline curve is the main curve representation method used in the field of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), and has become the standard for representing curves in this field. The definition of sub-B-spline curve is as follows: where, is the control point, is the sub-B-spline basis function defined on the node vector. And curve fitting refers to the use of continuous curves to approximately describe or compare the functional relationship between coordinates represented by discrete points. It is a method of approximating discrete data with analytical expressions. When the type of curve used is a B-spline curve, it is called B-spline curve fitting.
