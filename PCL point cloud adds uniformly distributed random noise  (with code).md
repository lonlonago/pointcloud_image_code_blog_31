##  1. Evenly distributed 

   In probability theory and statistics, a uniform distribution, also known as a rectangular distribution, is a symmetric probability distribution in which the probability of a distribution at the same length interval is equally likely. The uniform distribution is defined by two parameters, a and b, which are the minimum and maximum values on the number line, usually abbreviated as.
